## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Creating the webdesign is still a bit of a challenge for me. But it was really good to revise some things that i learned a bit ago. 

### Continued development

I wish to keep getting more confortable with CSS/SCSS and creating the designs for my landing pages. I'll probably get back on this project after i learn how to code in React, to create a better version of it.

### Useful resources

- [Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - The documentation already helped me in so many times that i lost count. If you're having any trouble on how to use a certain method, i highly suggest that you keep an eye on there.
